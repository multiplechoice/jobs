Spiders
=======

Scrapy based spiders that crawl for job listings.

Scrapes `Tvinna <http://www.tvinna.is/>`__, `Morgunblaðið <http://www.mbl.is/atvinna/>`__, `Vísir <https://job.visir.is/>`__ and `Alfreð <https://alfred.is/>`__ for job postings.

Updates to spiders are automatically detected by the project on `Scrapinghub <https://scrapinghub.com/>`__ and deployed.

This project relies upon the `multiplechoice/sqlalchemy-mappings` project to maintain the correct database structures.
